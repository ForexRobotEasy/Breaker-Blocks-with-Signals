# Breaker Blocks with Signals

This code is a sample implementation of the Breaker Blocks with Signals strategy. It is designed to be used in the MetaTrader 5 platform using MQL5.

## Input Parameters
- `swingSensitivity`: Sensitivity of detected swings used to construct breaker blocks

## Global Variables
- `premiumLevel`: Premium swing level
- `discountLevel`: Discount swing level

## Initialization
In the `OnInit()` function, the premium and discount levels are initialized to 0.

## On Tick
In the `OnTick()` function, the following actions are performed:
1. Calculate the premium and discount levels using the `CalculateSwingLevels()` function.
2. Check for breakout signals using the `CheckBreakoutSignals()` function.
3. Place potential take profit and stop loss levels using the `PlaceTakeProfitStopLossLevels()` function.

## Calculate Swing Levels
The `CalculateSwingLevels()` function implements logic to calculate the premium and discount swing levels based on the sensitivity parameter and current market conditions.

## Check Breakout Signals
The `CheckBreakoutSignals()` function implements logic to check for breakout signals between the price and breaker blocks. If a breakout signal is detected, necessary actions are performed.

## Place Take Profit and Stop Loss Levels
The `PlaceTakeProfitStopLossLevels()` function calculates and places potential take profit and stop loss levels based on the premium and discount swing levels.

## On Deinit
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It can be used to clean up any resources used by the indicator.

## On Tester
The `OnTester()` function is used for testing the code and ensuring it functions as intended. Any bugs or issues identified during testing should be addressed.
